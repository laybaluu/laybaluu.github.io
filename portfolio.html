										<h3>Food Pantry Impact Analysis</h3>
										<i>Freelance</i>
									</header>
									<p>Transitioned a local food pantry from keeping hardcopy food distribution records to recording data in a cloud-based 
										database. Streamlined data collection process for volunteers who now use an iPad to enter data into an Excel 
										spreadsheet, which gets automatically cleaned (PowerQuery) and fed into a front-facing Power BI report. 
										Volunteers, board members, and grant writers now have access to up-to-date and reliable data that 
										longitudinally tracks the pantry's impact and geographical reach.</p>

										<h3>Strategic Plan Implementation</h3>
										<i>Sangfroid Strategy</i>
									</header>
									<p>Designed a method for a nonprofit, early childhood education referral agency to implement 
										its 3-year strategic goals. Broke down goals into a set of benchmarks and steps that were placed into a backend spreadsheet. 
										Each step was assigned a department-owner, deadline, % complete, notes, and wins field. Guided technology-tentative 
										executive team how to update step progress, add new steps, and change deadlines. Created 1-pg how-to document and corresponding 
										video the executive team shared with department leaders. The spreadsheet is now used to power a frontend Looker Implementation Dashboard
										that tracks the progress of implementing the strategic plan, provides key updates to board members, and is used in end-of-year performance reviews.</p>

										<h3>Data Inventory & Recommendations</h3>
										<i>Sangfroid Strategy</i>
									</header>
										<p>One goal of the referral agency was to make their organization more data-driven. Met with leaders
											from the organization's Marketing, HR, Data, and Finance Departments to compile a list of 21 systems the organization used
											daily. Interviewed each department leader about systems they owned, what data they collected, what it was used for, which
											stakeholders needed that data, and why. With an understanding of the organization's strategic goals, recommended 10 steps for 
											merging data system outputs to create new KPIs that, when incorporated into steps and benchmarks powering the Implementation Dashboard, 
											now provides enhanced data-driven reporting for all stakeholders.</p>

										<h3>Workplan Template for Asana Import</h3>
										<i>Sangfroid Strategy</i>
									</header>
									<p>Collaborated with the internal executive team to improve project planning. Observed three key
										barriers: 
										<ol>
											<li> The project team entered all project phases, milestones, and tasks into Asana by hand. </li>  
											<li> Team members missed key dependencies that set projects off track. </li> 
											<li> The executive team and project team were not aligned with the project's timeline. </li>
										</ol>
										After interviews with the executive team and colleagues, created a spreadsheet template that listed all phases, milestones, 
										and tasks in sequential order. Followed Asana documentation to add columns for due dates, dependencies, subtasks, etc. so the project plan 
										template would be ready for import. During project kickoff meetings, the executive team quickly reviewed the plan with the project team 
										before it was approved for import into Asana with one click. Saved the company $15,000 in time and software costs.  
										Successfully launched three projects and onboarded four new employees using another iteration of the template. Created
										1-pg SOP and corresponding Loom video instructing future teams how to update the template and import it into Asana.

										<h3>Etsy Store Revenue & Market Analysis</h3>
										<i>Freelance</i>
									</header>
										<p>Helped an Etsy store optimize its stocking practices and target key customer segments
											for the 2023 holiday marketing sprint. Downloaded a Kaggle Dataset and converted it into a SQL 
											table in Jupyter Notebook using pandas. Ran set of python cleaning functions before querying data
											to track longitudinal revenue trends, average dollar amount spent and time spent on the website per customer. 
											Segmented customer demographics by age and gender to find key customer segment for store and newsletter.
											Plotted key data insights with matplotlib, documented key findings, and recommendations in the Notebook.  </p>
